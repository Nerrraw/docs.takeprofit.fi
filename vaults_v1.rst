***************************
ðŸ¥ž CAKE Vaults v1 (retired)
***************************

Rationale behind these vaults are to diversify portfolio, take profit and protect gains.
CAKE earned in Vault is converted automatically to other coin or set of coins.

We believe that in crypto it's not about putting all eggs to one basket.
For example it's reasonable to put 50% to Vault giving out CAKE/BUSD, 25% of CAKE to Vault giving out BNB,
and 25% to Vault giving out BTC/ETH.

Vaults v1 have performance fee 1% that goes for takeprofit.fi development.

Note: Currently Cake Swap has 0.25% fee for swapping which is paid for token conversion.
