ðŸ¤‘ How to Buy ProfitCake
************************

ProfitCake is easiest way to start with Take Profit Finance.
It is a token on Binance Smart Chain which gives out Cake and Profit dividend that can be then reinvested in Vaults.

Note: Recommended to read this guid on PC, and follow along on your Phone to make it easier. This will take approximately 15-30 minutes if you're new.

Step 1: Create a Wallet
==========================================================
Download `Trust Wallet <https://trustwallet.com>`_ and create a wallet. Keep your phrase a secret! Never share it with anyone and store it properly! Make sure to copy the contract address below!


Step 2: Add ProfitCake to the Wallet
==========================================================
Tap the icon in the top-right and "Add Custom Token".

At the top, tap "Ethereum" next to Network, and change it to "Smart Chain". Copy ProfitCake contract address 0x44836677fbedecaf0e7ab32d6dd082ef539b5f92 and put it in the Contract Address box.

Next, put "ProfitCake" as the name, and the symbol as PROFITCAKE. Decimals will be 18.

Click "Done" at the top and you should now have ProfitCake added to your wallet!


Step 3: Buy BNB
==========================================================
Tap on "Smart Chain" on the main screen of trust wallet, then tap "Buy" in the top right. This step may require KYC verification, so have documents ready to prove your identity.

If the transaction won't go through, you may need to contact your bank to allow international transactions.

After purchasing, there may be a delay while your transaction is processed. Be patient, this is normal!

Step 4: Swap BNB for ProfitCake!
==========================================================
Once your transaction has been cleared, and you have BNB on your Trust Wallet, Go to DApps (or "Browser" for iPhones) at the bottom of the main screen. If the Browser button is not visible at the bottom for iPhone, open Safari and in the URL type trust://browser_enable, then return to trust wallet.

Open the DApps, or Browser, section and find PancakeSwap and open it. Connect your Trust Wallet in the top-right. Scroll down a little to the "Exchange" box

Click the icon and set the slippage to at least 18%. If you want to give it the best possible change to clear, increase the deadline. By default it should be set to 30 minutes, which is fine.

Now select amount of BNB you wish to swap for ProfitCake, click Swap and wait patiently for the transaction to clear. This process may not be instant and can take anywhere from a few minutes up to an hour sometimes, depending on traffic.

Once the transaction has been cleared, you have ProfitCake in your Trust Wallet!

From this point you will regularly receive Cake and Profit dividend!

Now all that's left is to HODL!
